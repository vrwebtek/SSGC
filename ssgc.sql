Some of the significant indirect taxes include Value Added Tax, Central Sales Tax, Central Excise Duty, Customs Duty, stamp duties and expenditure tax. Unlike Direct Taxes, Indirect Taxes are not levied on individuals, but on goods and services. Customers indirectly pay this tax in the form of higher prices.</p>\r\n<p>For example, it can be said that while purchasing goods from a retail shop, the retail sales tax is actually paid by the customers. The retailer eventually passes this tax to the respective authority. The indirect tax, actually raises the price of a good and the customers purchase by paying more for that product.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="et_pb_section  et_pb_section_2 et_section_regular">\r\n<div class=" et_pb_row et_pb_row_1">\r\n<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4  et_pb_column_3">\r\n<div class="et_pb_text et_pb_module et_pb_bg_layout_light et_pb_text_align_justified  et_pb_text_12">\r\n<h3><em class="fa fa-chevron-right"> Meaning of Indirect Taxes</em></h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The term indirect tax can be defined from different views. In the colloquial sense, an indirect tax is the charge that is collected by intermediary (like retail store) from the individual who holds the actual economic burden of the tax ( like customer). The intermediary files a tax return and eventually passes to the government. The indirect tax can be alternatively defined as the charge that is paid by one individual at the beginning, but the burden of which will be passed over to some other individual, who eventually holds the burden. In a colloquial sense, one example of indirect tax includes VAT (Value Added Tax).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><em class="fa fa-chevron-right"> Basic difference: Direct and Indirect Taxes</em></h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The primary difference between a direct and indirect tax is that direct tax is levied directly by the government from the taxpayer, but indirect taxes are collected by the intermediary.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><em class="fa fa-chevron-right"> Indirect tax in India</em></h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The indirect tax in India constitutes a group of tax laws and regulations. The indirect taxes in India are enforced upon different activities including manufacturing, trading and imports.

(3, 1, 'Direct Tax', '<h3><em class="fa fa-chevron-right"> About Direct Tax ?</em></h3>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Direct Tax is the tax paid to the government directly by the assessee like the Income Tax or the Capital Gains Tax. There has been a steady rise in the net Direct Tax collections in India over the years.</p>\r\n<p>All the collections of the direct taxes in India like the Corporate Tax, Personal Income Tax, Securities Transaction Tax, Banking Cash Transaction Tax, and the Fringe Benefit Tax have been going through a healthy ascent. For instance, in the current year the personal income taxes collection have increased with the rate of TDS being higher than the previous years. Overall, as per the estimates of the Budget of the financial year 2006-07, the target of Direct Tax growth rate was estimated to be 27.5%, but so far it has exceeded this limit and reached 41.2%. At present, the net Direct Tax collection of India is at Rs.610.30 billion, which is estimated to rise to 42% over Rs.429.80 billion as it was in the last financial year. This growth in the rate of Direct Tax reflects a continued increase in the economy, high tax compliance, and better tax administration.</p>\r\n<p>One of the main forms of Direct Tax is the Taxes on Corporate Income, under which the companies residing in this country pays a tax on their global income arising from all sources. The payment of the tax follows the provisions of the Income Tax Act. On the other hand, the non-resident companies pay the Direct Tax on the income obtained from an India-based business connection. The resident companies pay a tax at the rate of 35% with a surcharge of 2.5% while for the non-resident companies the basic tax rate goes up to 40% along with the same 2.5% surcharge. Along with these the corporate companies also pay an education tax at the rate of 2% and a wealth tax at the rate of 1%. Moreover, a Minimum Alternative Tax at 7.5% also requires to be paid by the Domestic corporations.</p>\r\n<p>The Capital Gains Tax is another important form of Direct Tax in India which is payable on capital gains received upon the sale of assets. If the capital assets are in possession for more than three years and regarding the shares, stock exchange securities, mutual fund units the time frame for possessing the asset is one year. The basic tax rate of the long-term capital gains is fixed at 20% while for the short-term capital gains the rate is fixed at the normal corporate income tax rate. A rate of 10% is fixed on the transfer of equity shares from which the short-term capital gain emerges.</p>\r\n<p>Personal Income tax is another type of Direct Tax, which is under the Central Government controlled by the Central Board of Direct Taxes. The taxpayer is required to pay a tax if the income level reaches above ` 100,000. If the income reaches ` 850,000 there is a surcharge of 10% imposed on the total tax.</p>', 'direct-tax', '', ''),

FEMA has 49 Sections of which 9 Sections (Sections 1 to 9) are substantive and the rest are procedural or administrative. RBI is entrusted with the administration and implementation of FEMA.

For example, the term “Person of Indian Origin (PIO)” is defined differently in three Notifications, namely FEMA 13/2000-RB pertaining to remittance of assets, FEMA 21/2000-RB pertaining to acquisition and transfer of immovable property in India and FEMA 24/2000-RB pertaining to investment in a firm or a proprietary concern in India. The definition section of each Notification makes it clear that the words and expressions used therein, but not defined in that particular Notification, shall have the same meanings respectively assigned to them in the Act. Therefore, wherever a particular term is defined in the Notification, the meaning to be assigned is unique to that Notification and mostly cannot be applied to another.Thus, interpretation and application of FEMA provisions and Notifications require utmost care. FEMA is applicable to the whole of India. The expression “whole of India” would indicate that the provisions of the Act are applicable to all transactions taking place in India. Thus, any person who is present in India at the time of transaction has to comply with provisions of FEMA. FEMA is applicable to all branches, offices and agencies outside India owned or controlled by a person resident in India. Thus, FEMA has retained its extra-territorial application, as under FERA.The Enforcement of FEMA is done through Reserve Bank of India and Central Government. The power has been given to Central Government [section 46] and RBI [Section 47] to lay down detailed rules and regulations to carry out the various provisions of the Act. Where under Section 47 the reserve bank of India can make regulations governing procedural and administrative aspects of FEMA the central government have been given the power to make rules governing enforcement of FEMA.The Central Government has established a Directorate of Enforcement for the purpose of enforcement of Act [section 36]. Officers under Directorate of enforcement are known as officers of Enforcement. These officers can investigate the contraventions of FEMA.</p>', 'fema-compliance', '', ''),
